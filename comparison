noSQL Features Comparison
Key - Value	
Positives
in memory storage, caching fast reads, a trade-off between persistence level and speed, auto-sharding, sub-millisecond response, ~700 TPS, TTL option
Negatives
can lose ~5 minutes of data in RPO scenarios, lacking Durability / "eventual" persistence (can lose ~1 minute of data due to latency in replication), 
no encryption functionality, no complex querying.

Document	
Positives
catalog system/configuration data, JSON data, horizontal scaling, schema-less, sharding, built-in encryption functionality with WiredTiger storage, 
global deployment functionality, TTL indexing	
Negatives
no true Master-Master (achieved through sharding), transactional consistency concerns with multi-document updates (not a limitation in the newest version, 4.0)

Column Family
Positives
can handle heavy writes, highly scalable, Master-Master/ peerless "ring" topology, sharding, global deployment functionality	
Negatives
eventual consistency, complex modeling, and partitioning; do not support ACID transactions

Relational	
Positives
structured data, OLTP data, strong ACID compliance	
Negatives
not agile, rigid schema, doesn't handle high volume well compared to others, complex and less mature global deployment, lack of auto high availability, 
no in-memory/caching functionality built in, TTL (time to live)
